## Working with content bots ##

As a domain expert you know your content, that's all that's needed, no Machine Learning expertise required.

* First step is to experiment and [create your cotent bots]({{page version='' space='nuxeo-insight' page='creating-cotent-bots'}}). 

* You can then [manage and monitor them]({{page version='' space='nuxeo-insight' page='managing-content-bots'}}) and their evolution. 

* As you [publish and use them]({{page version='' space='nuxeo-insight' page='content-bots-governance'}}) you have full control on this governance. 

## Active improvements ##

Evolving content bots is a critical aspect of improving their ROI. 
This is achieved by adding more content and annotating it with the **human in the loop**. Nevertheless, we use **active learning** to optimize the human participation and make it as productive and eficient as we can.
Also, as not all performance aspects are on the same level, we let you decide what metadata is your priority and focus specifically on thoses, allowing a rapid evolution on what is **important for your business**.

## Roadmap ##
_Nuxeo Insight_ roadmap only takes into account strategic topics. 
The roadmap has cards which map to a strategic topic. On each card there's a title, details and ideas belonging to that topic. You can follow the status of each idea.

The roadmap has three sections:
* **Now**: being developed. We will normally focus on only one topic according with it's priority.
* **Next**: will be added to new column. Their priority can still change.
* **Later**: candidate topics currently in discovery mode. Over time, these will be promoted to the Next section, but they can still be removed.
